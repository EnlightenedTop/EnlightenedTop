Hi , i am Cristian from Romania and i have a passion for computer hardware and software/
This started early in my life when i played for the first time a video game on a knockoff nintendo 
system called Terminator 2000 or something like this.
At 7 years old i got my first computer and i would never forget that moment because it was one of the happiest moments, all the cool kids in the neighbourhood had a 
computer and now so did i :).
Since then i'm thinkering with how they work , starting from a hardware basis, i self learned how to diagnose them and repair them, later overclock,
bios modification , phisical-limitations modifications, mining crypto ,etc.
Since 2020 i got into videogames development , trying out with unreal engine 4 and unity.
Later that year i got into fullstack WebDeveloping since it seemed interesting to me , and i never even imagined how is the web made behind the scenese.
Since them i learned few technologies , now focusing on the front-end , building projects after doing few courses and experimenting on my own.
